Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _16.55 Ionized Gases_ as it was taught by associate Professor Paulo Lozano and Professor Emeritus Manuel Martinez-Sanchez in Fall 2014.

This course focused on the properties and behavior of ionized gases, or plasmas, including equilibrium, kinetic theory and gas surface interactions. Also covered was radiation in plasmas and diagnostics.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Understand how energy conversion, plasma propulsion, and gas lasers impact the properties and behavior of low-temperature plasmas.
*   Describe gas surface interactions, radiation in plasmas, and the ways in which these phenomena relate to diagnostics.
*   Apply the equilibrium and kinetic theory of ionized gases, along with an understanding of other theorems and their inter-relationships, to solve problems relating to low-temperature plasmas.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

This course prepares students for graduate study in the area of space propulsion engineering.
